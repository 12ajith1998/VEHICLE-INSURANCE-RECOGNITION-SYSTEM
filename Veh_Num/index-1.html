<h2 id="about-invictus">About Invictus</h2>
<p>Invictus is a set of jupyter notebooks showcasing how to accomplish specific computer vision task using the Python programming language.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h3>
<p>It is generally encouraged that you always use Python virtuan environment to have isolated Python installations per project. In this guide, I suggest you do the same. So 'cd' into the 'invictus' directory that you've cloned onto your computer and perform the following actions to run the notebooks in a separate virtual environment.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>python3 -m venv env</code></li>
<li><code>source /env/bin/activate</code></li>
<li><code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
<li><code>jupyter notebook</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="opening-notebooks">Opening Notebooks</h3>
<p>In invictus, every notebook is self-contained and demonstrates end-to-end flow of actions that must be taken to accomplish a given task. The name of a notebook file suggests its purpose.</p>
<p>Once you've started jupyter notebooks with the command <code>jupyter notebook</code> you must open http://localhost:8888/ in your browser to see the tree of files and directories in invictus.</p>
<p>Click on the <code>notebooks</code> folder and select your notebook of choice to see the code demonstration.</p>
